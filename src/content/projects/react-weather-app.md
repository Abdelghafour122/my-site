I built this back in 2022 when I was still learning React and even before I learned Tailwind CSS or TypeScript.

I refactored this not long ago and added TS to it.

## Features

- Simple UI built with MUI components
- Dark/light mode switching
- Weather data from OpenWeatherMap API
- Internationalization support with i18next (English, French and German)

## What I learned building this

- Basic React knowledge (how to go about handling state, props, and events)
- React codebase folder-structure & best practices
- How to use MUI components
- How to use i18next for internationalization
- How to consume APIs
- How to refactor old code and solve version conflicts
