I started learning backend development recently so I decided to build a simple todo app with Express, to get my head around the basic concepts.

This was when I no longer felt the need to continue learning new frontend techniques and to dive a bit into the infrastructure side of things.

## Features (so far):

- Authentication, Oauth
- RESTful apis built entirely with Express to handle CRUD functionality and database interactions

## Usage:

- Clone the repo
- TBD...

## Tech Stack:

- Reactjs
- Shadcn
- Express
- Postgres
- Drizzle ORM

## What I learned building this project:

- Linking Frontend and Backend
- How low level authentication works
- Linking a backend to a database
- What a reverse proxy is
- General REST apis structure and functionality
- TBD...
